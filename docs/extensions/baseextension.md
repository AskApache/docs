Bolt's BaseExtension Class
==========================

If you're developing custom code in your project or in an extension, you're
free to do it however you'd like, if you're proficient with Symfony. Regardless
of that, it is often very convenient to make the 'entrypoint' of your Extension
or custom code `extend` the `Bolt\BaseExtension` class.
