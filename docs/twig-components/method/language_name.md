# language_name

`language_name(locale = null)` is a Twig filter to return the language name given its two-letter code:

```twig
{# German #}
{{ 'de'|language_name }}
```

By default, the filter uses the current locale. You can pass it explicitly:

```twig
{# allemand #}
{{ 'de'|language_name('fr') }}

{# franÃ§ais canadien #}
{{ 'fr_CA'|language_name('fr_FR') }}
```

### Note

The `language_name filter` is part of the IntlExtension which is not installed by default. Install it first:

```twig
$ composer require twig/intl-extra
```

Then, on Symfony projects, install the `twig/extra-bundle`:

```twig
$ composer require twig/extra-bundle
```

Otherwise, add the extension explicitly on the Twig environment:

```twig
use Twig\Extra\Intl\IntlExtension;

$twig = new \Twig\Environment(...);
$twig->addExtension(new IntlExtension());
```
