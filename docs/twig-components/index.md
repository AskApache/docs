Twig tags, functions & filters
==============================

As mentioned before, a template in Bolt can use all of the standard Twig tags,
function, filters, tests & operators, with a few additions that are specific to
working with Bolt. If you're not familiar with Twig yet, you should read
"[Twig for Template Designers][twig]", on the official Twig website.
