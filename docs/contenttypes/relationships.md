Relationships
=============

You can define relationships between records by adding a relation to
`contenttypes.yaml`.

```yaml
pages:
    name: Pages
    singular_name: Page
    [..]

entries:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    fields:
        [..]
    relations:
        pages:
            multiple: false
            required: false
            label: Select a related page
            order: -id
    [..]
```

The `relations` are defined by the `slug` of the ContentType that it's related to. If a slug is not explicitly defined for a ContentType, the `name` is used. In the example above, it is `pages`. It takes a few parameters:

| Parameter  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `required` | `true` or `false`, to determine if the user must pick a related record. Defaults to `true`. |
| `multiple` | `true` or `false`, to indicate whether the user can pick one related record, or more than one.  Defaults to `false`. |
| `label` | The label to show on the edit screen. |
| `order` | The order in which the items are listed on the edit screen. This can be any field in the ContentType. Prefix with `-` to reverse the sorting. In the case of the example, `-id` means that the records that were created last are at the top.
| `format` | How to show the titles for each record that can be selected. For example if you have two fields for firstname and lastname you might put `'{{firstname}} {{lastname}}'` here. The default is `'{title} (â„– {id}, {status})'` |

Editing a record that has relations defined looks like this:

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7093518/91450856-0d4e1b00-e87d-11ea-847e-13a075ddf164.png" class="popup"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7093518/91450856-0d4e1b00-e87d-11ea-847e-13a075ddf164.png" width="350"></a>

If you see this, you might consider adding the reverse relation to the
`contenttypes.yaml` as well.

Relations in templates
----------------------
To get the related records in twig, use the _filter_ `related`.

```
    {% set relatedrecords = record|related %}
    {% if relatedrecords is not empty %}
        <p>Related content:</p>
        <ul>
        {% for related in relatedrecords %}
            <li><a href="{{ related|link }}">{{ related.title }}</a></li>
        {%  endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
```

Relations and directions
------------------------
Relationships have a direction; they point _from_ a content record _to_ another.
This directionality comes into play when fetching related records.

For example, you may have a contenttype `entries` that has a relation to
`entries` itself; this allows you to show hand-selected "related posts".

The record in which you've selected another record, in the Relations tab, will
be the "from" end of the relation. The record you've selected there is the "to"
end.

The directionality in relations allows you to either select _all_ records with a
relation to the current record, in any direction, or you can specify that you
only want one of the directions.

Let's take this example:

```yaml
entries:
    name: Entries
    singular_name: Entry
    fields:
        [..]
    relations:
        entries:
            multiple: true
            required: false
            label: Select one or more related entries
            order: -id
    [..]
```

Then, after adding some content and making relations between the entries, we can
display them in the templates using the `related()` method. If you'd use the
previous example of Twig code, you'd get _all_ related records for the current
record, regardless of contenttype or direction.

Using the second parameter of the `related()` method, you can specify which
relations you want to see. For instance, to only display relations to other
records of the `entries` contenttype, that the current record is the "from" end
for, you'd do this:

```twig
    {% set relatedrecords = record|related("entries", "from") %}
    {% if relatedrecords is not empty %}
        <p>Related content:</p>
        <ul>
        {% for related in relatedrecords %}
            <li><a href="{{ related|link }}">{{ related.title }}</a></li>
        {%  endfor %}
        </ul>
    {% endif %}
```
