Image field
===========

Simple image upload/select field.

## Basic Configuration:

```yaml
        cover:
            type: image
```

## Example usage in templates:

```twig
{{ record.cover|showimage() }}
```
or
```twig
{{ record.cover|thumbnail() }}
```
or
```twig
{{ record.cover|popup() }}
```
See [Bolt Template tags](../templating/twig-functionality) for more info.

## Options:

The field has a few options to change the appearance and functionality of the
field.

* `extensions` Allows you to restrict users to only be able to upload files with
  certain file extensions.
* `attrib` Can be set to a custom attribute, such as alt-texts, titles, captions or data-attributes. For example:
  * `alt` Show a text field for the `alt` parameter
  * `title` Show a text field for the `title` parameter
  * `caption` Show a custom field for a `caption` that image will use in your template
  * `[alt, title, caption]` Add more than one attribute
* `upload` Allows you to upload files for this field into a specified directory
  so they remain grouped. This directory will be created in `{%web%}/files/`

```yaml
        cover:
            type: image
            attrib: [alt, title, caption]
            extensions: [ gif, jpg, png ]
            upload: portfolio
```

You can call these in your templates by using `{{ record.values.image.alt }}`
or `{{ record.values.image.caption }}` and they will also be automatically used by
bolt's image functions.
