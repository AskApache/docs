In the profile screen you can edit your user. You can edit your password, your
email and your display name.

Your email will be used for various ways to contact you, but primarily for
password resets. It is therefore important that you set it to a email address
that you and only you can access.

Your display name will be used when showing who wrote a peice of content in the
frontend.
