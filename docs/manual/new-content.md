Creating content
================

You are now on the page for creating a new record of your ContentType:

<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7093518/91454105-ded23f00-e880-11ea-8d21-4d3432895014.png" class="popup"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7093518/91454105-ded23f00-e880-11ea-8d21-4d3432895014.png" width="590"></a><br>

Simply fill in a title, a teaser text to be used in listings and a body text to
be used when the entry is viewed by itself. Then click on save entry and you
have created your first record in bolt!

Now lets move on to the next [step](edit-content), about editing existing
content.
